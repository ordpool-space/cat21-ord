# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Fork of the [ord client](https://github.com/ordinals/ord) with CAT-21 indexing via the **fake inscription** approach. Branch: `index-cat21`.

The idea: teach ord to recognize `nLockTime=21` transactions as inscriptions. They're not real inscriptions — there's no `OP_FALSE OP_IF` envelope on-chain — but ord doesn't need to know that. Once it treats them as inscriptions, all of ord's infrastructure (sat tracking, transfers, API) works automatically.

Inspired by `labitbu/pathologies` (Labitbu's ord fork for indexing pathologies).

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test
# See the wiki for full setup: https://github.com/ordpool-space/cat21-ord/wiki
```

## CAT-21 Development Rules

### Code Organization
- Mark all CAT-21 code blocks with `// CAT-21 😺 - START` and `// CAT-21 😺 - END`
- Minimize changes to core ord code — the fork must stay easily mergeable with upstream
- Don't change existing lines if possible; prefer adding new code alongside existing code

### The `--index-cat21` Flag
Without the flag, ord behaves 100% like upstream. With `--index-cat21`, the indexer:
- Ignores all real inscriptions (doesn't even parse tapscript witnesses)
- Checks `nLockTime == 21` on every transaction
- Creates a fake empty envelope for matching transactions
- Uses `first_cat21_height` (block 815855) instead of `first_inscription_height`

### Key Files (CAT-21 changes)
1. **`src/options.rs`** — `--index-cat21` CLI flag definition
2. **`src/settings.rs`** — Wires flag through settings, overrides `first_inscription_height()` when active
3. **`src/chain.rs`** — Defines `first_cat21_height()` (block 815855, genesis cat)
4. **`src/index/updater/inscription_updater.rs`** — Core logic: nLockTime check + fake envelope creation

### What ord handles automatically
Once cats appear as inscriptions:
- Sat assignment (first sat of first output)
- Transfer tracking across transactions
- API endpoints (`/inscription/<txid>i0`)
- Address lookups
- Database storage

### Important flags
- `--index-cat21` — REQUIRED (enables CAT-21 indexing mode)
- `--index-sats` — REQUIRED (sat tracking for ordinal theory)
- `--index-addresses` — recommended (address lookups)
- Do NOT use `--no-index-inscriptions` — cats ARE inscriptions in this approach

### Fork Management
- **PR #1 stays open permanently** — it documents the full delta against upstream. Never merge it.
- **Squash all changes into a single commit** on `index-cat21`. One commit = one diff = easy rebase. No commit clutter.
- **Rebase onto upstream, never merge** — when upstream releases a new version, rebase `index-cat21` onto `upstream/master` and force push. Merge commits create clutter.
- **Keep changes minimal** — every line we change is a potential merge conflict. Only touch what's necessary.

### Documentation
- `FORK.md` — technical description of what this fork changes and how
- [Wiki](https://github.com/ordpool-space/cat21-ord/wiki) — setup guides for humans (Developer HowTo, Bitcoin guides, Ord guide)
- When making changes, review `FORK.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, and the [wiki](https://github.com/ordpool-space/cat21-ord/wiki) for outdated information and update them. The wiki repo can be cloned at `git@github-ord-dev:ordpool-space/cat21-ord.wiki.git`.
