# Developer HowTo for `cat21-ord`

Super quick howto to jump into coding (or building the executable).


## 0. Prerequisites

VS Code and/or Cursor is recommended for development.
Read more about Rust development with VS Code here:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust


## 1. Clone the repo

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ordpool-space/cat21-ord.git
cd cat21-ord
```


## 2. Debugging with VS Code (while using a remote Bitcoin RPC) on a Mac

> You want this option when you want to develop new features.
> On a normal working machine, with normal hardware (less than 64 GB RAM).

1. Install the VS Code extension rust-analyzer: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer and this if you are on a Mac: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb

2. Install rust `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`, follow the instructions to configure your current shell.

3. `rustc --version` must work!

4. `cd cat21-ord` into the repo

5. `cargo build`, once built, the `ord` binary (debug build) can be found at `./target/debug/ord`.

6. `cargo run`

7. You'll need to enable the setting `Debug: Allow Breakpoints Everywhere`, which you can find in the Settings editor (`âŒ˜,`) by searching on 'everywhere`.

8. Generate a new `launch.json` by trying to debug (VS Code should create one for you)

9. Add a configuration like this to your `launch.json`

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "lldb",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug executable 'ord' INDEX-SATS (Localhost RPC Setup)",
            "cargo": {
                "args": [
                    "build",
                    "--bin=ord",
                    "--package=ord"
                ],
                "filter": {
                    "name": "ord",
                    "kind": "bin"
                }
            },
            "args": [
              "--index-sats",
              "--index-addresses",
              "--no-index-inscriptions",
              "--bitcoin-rpc-username=xxx",
              "--bitcoin-rpc-password=yyy",
              "server"
            ],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
        },
        {
            "type": "lldb",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug executable 'ord' INDEX-SATS (Remote RPC Setup)",
            "cargo": {
                "args": [
                    "build",
                    "--bin=ord",
                    "--package=ord"
                ],
                "filter": {
                    "name": "ord",
                    "kind": "bin"
                }
            },
            "args": [
              "--index-sats",
              "--index-addresses",
              "--no-index-inscriptions",
              "--bitcoin-rpc-url=192.0.2.1:8332",
              "--bitcoin-rpc-username=xxx",
              "--bitcoin-rpc-password=yyy",
              "server"
            ],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
```

## 3. Building & Running a `cat21-ord` server (not a normal ord) on Linux

> You want this option when you want to build the full damn index.
> On a beafy server, 64 GB RAM, 2TB SSD. Do not try lower hardware!

1. Bitcoin must be up and running, see `1_bitcoin-guide-for-mac.md` or `1_bitcoin-guide-for-linux.md`.

    Feel free to use the files in `deploy-ord-dev` for a fast setup:

    ```
    sudo cp ./deploy-ord-dev/bitcoind.service /etc/systemd/system/
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable bitcoind
    sudo systemctl start bitcoind
    sudo systemctl status bitcoind

    tail -F -n 10000 ~/.bitcoin/debug.log
    ```

2. Install rust via curl (rustup) or homebrew, both should work:

    * Rustup is officially recommended.
      `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` to install.
      Follow the instructions to configure your current shell.
      But then you realise that you still need to take care of the dependencies, such as OpenSSL.
      So you might want to execute `rustup self uninstall` to uninstall, and use brew again! ðŸ˜‡
      Check your path via `echo $PATH` to see if it's clean again.

    * `brew install rust` requires no additional steps

3. `rustc --version` must work!

4. `cd cat21-ord` into the repo

5. `cargo build --release`, once built, the `ord` binary (release build) can be found at `./target/release/ord`.

6. You can now execute the CAT-21 version of `ord`:

    * Running the binary directly: `./target/release/ord --version`
    * Running via cargo: `cargo run --release -- --version` (If youâ€™ve made changes to the code, cargo run will automatically rebuild the project before running it, ensuring you're always running the latest version of your code. If you don't make changes to the code, both options are fine.)

7. Start the indexing:

  ```sh
  ./target/release/ord \
    --index-sats \
    --index-addresses \
    --no-index-inscriptions \
    server \
    --http-port 8080
  ```

9. Run the ord daemon permanently:

    ```sh
    sudo cp /home/ord-dev/cat21-ord/deploy-ord-dev/ord.service /etc/systemd/system/
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable ord
    sudo systemctl start ord
    sudo systemctl status ord
    ```

    To view the full logs for your `ord` service managed by `systemd`, you can use `journalctl`, which collects logs for all systemd-managed services.
    This will show the complete log history:

    ```sh
    sudo journalctl -u ord
    ```

    Or follow the logs in real-time (like `tail -f`):

    ```
    sudo journalctl -u ord -f
    ```

    To delete logs older than a specific time period, such as 1 week:
    ```
    sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1w
    ```
